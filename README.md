🧑‍💼 Employee Management System (OOP Project in Python)
This project is a console-based Employee Management System built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python. It simulates real-life employee behavior and management inside an office environment.

🚀 Features:
Person Class: Models basic human actions such as sleeping, eating, and buying items.

Employee Class: Inherits from Person and adds work-related behavior like working hours, driving, and salary management.

Car Class: Represents the employee's car, including fuel consumption, velocity, and ability to drive to work.

Office Class: Manages employee hiring, firing, rewards, deductions, and lateness checks.

📋 What You Can Do:
Create a Person who can eat, sleep, and buy items.

Upgrade the person to an Employee once hired.

Drive to work and consume fuel based on distance and velocity.

Refuel the car and track remaining distance if fuel runs out.

Reward or deduct salary based on punctuality.

Manage a list of employees in the Office class.

🧠 Concepts Used:
Encapsulation and property decorators

Inheritance

Class vs static methods

Realistic fuel and travel simulations

Console-based menu system for interaction
